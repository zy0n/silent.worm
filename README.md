## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Silent.Worm is an innovative AI agent swarm designed to tackle complex tasks and challenges by harnessing the collective intelligence of a network of artificial intelligence agents. Developed with cutting-edge technologies, Silent.Worm operates as a cohesive unit, demonstrating adaptability, learning capabilities, and efficient problem-solving.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Python 3.11
========= docker use only ======
docker 
2GB hdd space for docker image
```

### Installing
##### If running locally, make sure all deps are installed.
```sh
# activate virtual-environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### If running in docker, install deps in the docker.
```sh
# available scripts to run
docker/build.sh # builds docker
docker/run.sh # runs docker
docker/update.sh # builds docker & launches

```
